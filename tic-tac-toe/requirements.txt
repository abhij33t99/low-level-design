Low-Level Design: Tic Tac Toe Game 🎲
Tic Tac Toe, known colloquially as "Xs and Os," is a two-player game typically played on a 3x3 grid. The objective is simple: be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three of your marks (either "X" or "O"). The elegance of the game lies in its deceptive complexity, while the rules are straightforward, devising an unbeatable strategy demands a keen understanding of the game's dynamics.


Rules of the game :
Firstly let's understand the rules of the game:

• Setup: The game is played on a 3 * 3 grid. One player uses 'X' another player uses 'O' and each player takes turns making their moves.
• Winner: The game is won by the player placing his or her symbol in a row, column, or diagonal. The first player to get three symbols in a row wins the game. When the player reaches this, the game ends immediately.
• Draw: If all the grid cells are filled and no player has three symbols in a row, the game will be a tie or a draw.
• Illegal Moves: A player cannot place his or her symbol on a tile occupied by an opponent's symbol or their own symbol. The move must be made to an empty cell.



the key requirements:
1. A 3x3 game board.
2. Two human players.
3. Alternating turns between 'X' and 'O'.
4. Move validation to ensure no wrong moves are made.
5. Detection of win or draw scenarios.
